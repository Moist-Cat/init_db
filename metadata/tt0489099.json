	"description": "In Ann Arbor, Michigan, teenager David Rice (Hayden Christensen) gives his crush, Millie (Annasophia Robb), a snow globe containing the Eiffel Tower, knowing her dreams of traveling someday. A bully, Mark (Jesse James), throws the globe onto the ice near a river. While trying to retrieve it, David falls through the ice and is pulled away by the current. He suddenly finds himself in the local library with drenched clothes. He discovers he can \"Jump\", or Teleport, disappearing from one place and instantly appearing in another. Unhappy with his life, he runs away and is believed dead by his alcoholic father.Eight years later, an adult David (Hayden Christensen) has settled into a life of adventure. He spends his days jumping around various continents, doing various sports and living lavishly using money stolen from banks via his jumping abilities. We also see him observing a natural disaster on the TV news, but not even consider using his power to save the people. After a day of hedonistic jumping, including seducing and sleeping with a woman in London, he is ambushed in his home by Roland Cox (Samuel L. Jackson). Cox tries to trap him with a system of high-voltage cables, which prevent him from being able to jump. David escapes and returns home to Ann Arbor, seeking the now adult Millie (Rachel Bilson). He is attacked by Mark (Teddy Dunn) and purposely Teleports him into a bank vault. He leaves him there and returns to Millie, inviting her to travel with him (by conventional means) to Rome. Roland - who we see heads an organization dedicated to killing these \"abominations\" because \"only God should have the power to be everywhere\" - later discovers Mark in police custody and so learns David's identity.David and Millie arrive in Rome, David attempting to keep his true nature as a thief and his power a secret from her. After talking, they have sex. David and Millie visit the Colosseum, only to find it closed. David uses his ability to unlock a door from the inside, telling a skeptical Millie the door was already unlocked. While opening another door, he discovers another Jumper, Griffin (Jamie Bell). He warns David that \"Paladins\" are coming - an extremist group which has been tracking down and killing Jumpers from \"the beginning\". Several Paladins show up and attack them. Griffin kills one and Teleports, taking the body with him. David tries to leave with Millie but is detained by Italian police and questioned about the death. While waiting for a magistrate to arrive, David's mother Mary (Diane Lane), who had left David when he was five, appears and throws him the keys to his handcuffs. She tells him he has very little time to leave. David tries to follow her, but she says if he wants the girl to live, he must leave now. David tells Millie the police let him go and they leave together. Millie, now very suspicious, demands the truth. David declines and puts her on a plane home.David jumps to Griffin's lair, asking where to find Roland. Griffin explains that Paladins are religious fanatics who believe Jumpers are an affront to God and have been hunting them for centuries. He also says that Paladins will kill Jumpers by targeting their loved ones. He has been trying to kill Roland for years, as the Paladins killed his parents when he was a child and have tried to kill him several times. David Teleports to his father, finds him bleeding and Teleports him to a hospital. He returns to Griffin and convinces him to go with him to the airport to greet Millie.Upon arriving, they realize her flight landed an hour earlier. Griffin returns to his lair to get weapons while David searches for Millie. He breaks into her apartment, angering Millie, who tells him to leave. Through the living room window David sees Roland arriving and shows her what he can do, and saves her, by Teleporting her back to Griffin's lair. The Paladins follow using a machine that keeps the \"jump scar\" (wormhole) open and fight with David and Griffin. Roland is chased back through the portal, but snatches Millie back to her apartment with a cable.Griffin decides to take a bomb to Millie's apartment and kill everyone. David refuses, wanting to save Millie. They fight through several locations, and David traps Griffin with power lines in Chechnya, while there is an ongoing battle between Russian troops and Islamic militants. Griffin warns that if he faces the Paladins alone, he will be outnumbered. He goes anyway and is quickly trapped by Roland's electric cables. David cannot escape as he is physically tied to the apartment by the cables. Using his Teleporting powers David separates the apartment from the rest of the building and Teleports that section away, along with Roland, Millie and himself, back to the river into which he fell through the ice as a child. Once free of the cables (while still underwater) David Teleports to the library with Millie, as well as an unwelcome Roland. David then grabs Roland and takes him to a cave in the Grand Canyon, abandoning him there, and telling him that he could have had him killed instead.David visits his mother and is stunned when a girl, his half-sister, Sophie (Kristen Stewart), answers the door. Mary tells David she has known he was a Jumper since he was five, when Jumpers make their first Jump. She is a Paladin and had to either kill David or leave. She again allows him to leave, allowing him a \"head start\". He meets with Millie outside, and they jump to an unknown location.",
