	"description": "In 2263, Earth is devastated by a catastrophic interplanetary war known as \"The Fall\" or \"The Great War\". 300 years later, in the junkyard metropolis of Iron City, scientist Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) discovers a disembodied female cyborg with an intact human brain. Ido attaches a new cyborg body to the brain, who has no memories, and names her \"Alita\" (Rosa Salazar) after his deceased daughter, for whom he originally built the body. Alita awakens, and meets Dr. Chiren (Jennifer Connelly), Ido's estranged ex-wife, and befriends the charismatic Hugo (Keean Johnson) (a morally conflicted scrap dealer), who dreams of moving to the wealthy sky city of Zalem (the last great city left). Hugo introduces Alita to Motorball, a battle Royale sport played by cyborg gladiators. Secretly, Hugo robs cyborgs of their parts for Vector (Mahershala Ali), owner of the Motorball tournament, to build his own unbeatable champion. Chiren wants Ido to work with her to create cyborgs for Motorball, but Ido refuses to help her. Chiren secretly works for Vector. Hugo reckons since all trash in Iron City comes from Zalem, then Alita must have been in Zalem at one time.One night, Alita follows Ido and discovers he is a Hunter-Warrior; they are ambushed by three cyborg serial killers led by Grewishka (Jackie Earle Haley). Ido is injured, and Alita instinctively kills two of the cyborgs and damages Grewishka, who retreats underground. Despite Alita having rediscovered her past skill in the ancient martial art of \"Panzer Kunst\" (a German expression, meaning \"the art of the armor\" or \"the armored arts,\") Ido discourages her from becoming a Hunter-Warrior. As a hunter warrior, Ido hunts for rouge cyborgs & gives them to the factory for money, with which he runs his clinic to repair damaged cyborgs. He reveals that since his daughter Alita was killed by a rouge cyborg, killing them brings him mental peace. Ido also tells Alita that her \"heart\" is made of Pre-war tech and is strong enough to power the whole Iron city for generations. By implication, Alita is hundreds of years old.Grewishka works for Vector and gets Chiren to fix him. The overlord of Zalem, Nova, speaks to Vector through Grewishka and tells Vector to kill Alita and bring her to him in Zalem. He knows Alita's past.\nAlita finds a highly advanced cyborg body in a crashed spaceship outside the city. Recognizing the body as a Berserker - lethal shock troops of the enemy United Republics of Mars (URM) - Ido refuses to install Alita in it.Frustrated, Alita registers as a Hunter-Warrior. At the Kansas Bar, she and Hugo are unable to recruit other Hunter-Warriors to take down Grewishka. The narcissistic Zapan (Ed Skrein) (an arrogant sword-wielding cyborg bounty hunter who develops an egotistic vendetta against Alita) provokes Alita. She then severely beats him in a fight, triggering a chaotic bar brawl until Ido intervenes. An upgraded Grewishka arrives and challenges Alita to a duel, revealing he has been sent by Zalem's technocrat overlord, Nova, to destroy her. Despite her courage and combat skills, Alita's body is sliced up by Grewishka's chain-bladed fingers (these new arms were stolen by Hugo and delivered to Vector and Hugo recognizes them on Grewishka), but Ido, Hugo, and Hunter-Warrior McTeague force Grewishka to retreat. Ido transplants Alita into the Berserker body. In the new body, Alita remembers that she was created and trained to kill Nova.Having fallen in love with Hugo, Alita enters a Motorball tryout race for the prize money to send Hugo to Zalem. Ido warns Alita that the other contestants are wanted cyborgs hired by Vector, under Nova's orders, to kill her but she destroys many of them in the competition. Hugo's relationship with Alita leads him to decide to quit his secret job. He confronts his gang, in the process of mugging another cyborg, but Zapan appears, murdering the cyborg and framing Hugo. Hugo calls Alita for help; she abandons the race and finds him just as Zapan does. Zapan mortally wounds Hugo and tells Alita that Hunter-Warrior law dictates that she must either kill Hugo (Since he is a criminal now) or let Zapan finish him off.Chiren witnesses Alita's love for Hugo and decides to betray Vector by offering Alita to save Hugo by attaching his severed head to Alita's life support system. Alita tries to smuggle Hugo's head from the factory bots by hiding him under her jacket, but Zapan sees through the trick and attempts to stop Alita, she then seizes his prized Damascus blade and slices his face off.Ido transplants Hugo's head onto a cyborg body and tells Alita that Vector's offer to help Hugo reach Zalem was a lie; as an exiled citizen of Zalem, Ido is certain that citizens of Iron City cannot enter Zalem unless becoming a motor-ball champion. Alita storms the factory and confronts Vector, who reveals that Chiren has been harvested for her organs. Vector summons Grewishka, but Alita's new Nanomolecular body allows her to destroy him with ease. She forces Nova to speak to her through Vector. When Nova threatens to harm her friends, Alita fatally stabs Vector.Ido tells Alita that Hugo has fled to climb a cargo tube towards Zalem. Alita catches up to him and pleads with him to return with her. He agrees, but a serrated defense ring dropped by Nova shreds his body and throws him off the tube. Hugo, realizing he is too damaged to survive, thanks Alita for saving him before falling to his death.\nMonths later, Alita is the star of the Motorball tournament. Cheered on by the crowd, she pledges vengeance by pointing her sword toward Zalem, where Nova watches from above, smirking in anticipation.",
