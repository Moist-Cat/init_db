After Davit threw a DEA agent off a bridge, he was imprisoned and unable to bribe his way out due to the pressure from the Americans. Davit forces Ketevan and her children to move into the prison to keep them from leaving him, but the bad living conditions and Davit's abuse cause Ketevan to call Mia for help. Sandro believes that Davit is right and is training him to be grow up into a Nagazi.Meanwhile, a governor on his payroll informs Davit's brother Zurab (Tornike Gogrichiani) that Davit's sentence is extended by ten years. Zurab asks the governor to release his brother, but the governor refuses since he does not want the Americans to go after him. Enraged, Zurab kills the governor and his bodyguards.Alcott tells Tyler that Davit and Zurab run a billion dollars heroin operation from Georgia. Their gang members are fiercely loyal to the brothers and are treated like family. They have all the politicians in their pocket and practically run the country. Once Tyler picks up Ketevan and her kids, Zurab will throw the entire Nagazi army at him.\nTyler starts preparing for the mission by pushing himself physically.Tyler recruits Nik (Golshifteh Farahani) and her brother Yaz (Adam Bessa) to join him, and they infiltrate the prison with help from a bribed guard. Davit alerts the prisoners, who start a riot. During the extraction, Davit attacks Tyler and Ketevan, resulting in Tyler killing him. Sandro doesn't see Tyler killing Davit as Tyler had sent him and Nina ahead with Nik, while he stayed behind to deal with Davit and his mob. Ketevan stayed behind to help Tyler, but soon their exit is blocked.\nTyler and Ketevan fight their way through the riot and an entire yard full of prisoners. Nik picks up Tyler and Ketevan at the prison door, and they drive away just as Zurab and his forces descend upon the prison.\nAs Zurab's forces attack their vehicles, Sandro figures out that Davit has died. The group manages to fight off their pursuers and board on armored train waiting for them at an industrial complex.On the train, Tyler fights off 2 helicopters sent by Zurab to intercept them.

Nik realizes that this is not just a job, it is personal for Tyler.\nSandro confronts Tyler, who tells Sandro that Davit was keeping Ketevan prisoner against her wishes.

Refusing, Zurab kills Avtandil and contacts Tyler, telling him to meet at a nearby airfield next to a church. Tyler heads to the airfield but, unwilling to risk losing her, leaves Nik behind.\nTyler kills the remaining Nagazi and finds Zurab and Sandro in the church, with Sandro wearing an explosive vest. Zurab forces Sandro to take Tyler's pistol, but Sandro, having realized his mistake and what kind of people his father and uncle really are, refuses to shoot Tyler. Nik arrives and disarms the vest, while Tyler fights and kills Zurab.\nTyler and Nik are left wounded as police storm the church.In the aftermath, Nik and Tyler are imprisoned and Mia informs Tyler that Ketevan and her children have been moved to protective custody. Mia helped Ketevan make a deal with the Americans to disclose the operations of the Nagazi, but their financial assets are frozen, locking Ketevan out of any money. Tyler tells her to give them $1 million cash, which he had hidden under the floorboards in his cabin. She assures Tyler that their son died believing his father was a hero.\nTyler is taken out of prison to meet with the stranger from the beginning, who has come with another job, in return for Tyler's freedom.
