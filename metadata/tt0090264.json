	"description": "MI6 agent James Bond (Roger Moore) is sent to Siberia to locate the body of 003 and recover a Soviet microchip. Upon doing so, he is ambushed by Soviet troops but flees in a submarine. Q analyzes the microchip, establishing it to be a copy of one designed to withstand an electromagnetic pulse, made by government contractor Zorin Industries. somebody inside Zorin is connected to the KGB..\nMiss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) & Frederick Gray (Geoffrey Keen), the British Minister of Defence.Bond visits Ascot Racecourse to observe the company's owner, Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) (a psychopathic industrialist, the product of a Nazi genetic experiment, who plans to destroy Silicon Valley to gain a monopoly in the microchip market). Sir Godfrey Tibbett (Patrick Macnee), a racehorse trainer and MI6 agent, believes Zorin's horses, which win consistently, are drugged, although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine, who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a horse sale later in the month. During their dinner at the Eiffel Tower, Aubergine is assassinated by Zorin's bodyguard May Day (Grace Jones) (Zorin's lover and chief of staff. She seemingly possesses superhuman strength), who subsequently escapes (rescued by Zorin in a speedboat in the river).Bond and Tibbett travel to Zorin's estate for the horse sale. Tibbet poses as Bond's valet. Tibbet wanders into the stables and finds one horse vanishes after being brought into the stables. Bond notices a woman visiting Zorin, who has written her a check for $5 million. At night, Bond and Tibbett break into Zorin's laboratory, where he is implanting adrenaline-releasing devices in his horses. They also find Zorin's warehouse with millions of crates of microchips.\nZorin identifies Bond as an agent, has May Day assassinate Tibbett, and attempts to have Bond killed by dropping their car in the lake (with both Bond and Tibbet inside) (Bond survives by breathing air from the tires). General Gogol (Walter Gotell) of the KGB confronts Zorin for killing Bond without permission, revealing that Zorin was initially trained and financed by the KGB but has now gone rogue. Later, Zorin unveils to a group of investors his plan (\"Main Strike\") to destroy Silicon Valley, which will give him-and the potential investors-a monopoly over microchip manufacture. Silicon valley has 250 plants producing 80% of the world's supply of micro chips. Zorin wants $100MM from each investor for this task.Bond goes to San Francisco and meets with CIA agent Chuck Lee (David Yip), who claims Zorin is the product of medical experimentation with steroids performed by Dr. Carl Mortner (Willoughby Gray), a Nazi scientist who is now Zorin's physician. Mortner was grabbed by the KGB after the war, and hence was never tried for war crimes. Bond then investigates a nearby oil rig owned by Zorin (after reports that all crabs near that oil station just disappeared), and while there finds KGB agent Pola Ivanova (Fiona Fullerton) recording conversations and her partner placing explosives on the rig. Ivanova's partner is caught by May Day and killed (Bond has gone underwater to check what Zorin was up to. The pumps were turned on and Bond had use his Oxygen tank to jam the fans and escape. This led to a search and capture of Pola's partner. Zorin thinks KGB wants to eliminate him), but Ivanova and Bond escape. They spend a night together recounting past stories and Pola sees Bond take the recording. Later Ivanova takes the recording from Bond's case, but finds that Bond had switched tapes.\nBond is perplexed that Zorin is pumping seawater into his pipelines.Bond tracks down State Geologist Stacey Sutton (Tanya Roberts) at the California office of conservation, the woman Zorin attempted to pay off, and discovers that Zorin is trying to buy her family oil business. Stacey tells Bond how she has used all of her money to fight Zorin in the courts and has sold even her furniture. The two travel to San Francisco City Hall to check Zorin's submitted plans (on how many oil wells he has near the silicon valley area) after Bond tells Stacey that Zorin is pumping sea water into his oil wells instead of taking crude out (this has the potential to trigger a major quake). However, Zorin, who has been alerted to their presence, kills the Chief Geologist and Lee, and sets fire to the building to frame Bond for the murders and kill him at the same time (by trapping them inside an elevator and setting fire to it). Bond and Stacey escape in a fire engine when the police try to arrest him.Bond and Stacey infiltrate Zorin's mine, discovering his plot to detonate explosives beneath the lakes along the Hayward and San Andreas faults, which will cause them to flood (produce a massive earthquake as a result) and submerge Silicon Valley forever. A larger bomb is also in the mine to destroy a \"geological lock\" that prevents the two faults from moving simultaneously. Once in place, Zorin and his security chief Scarpine (Patrick Bauchau) flood the mines and kill the workers. Stacey escapes while Bond fights May Day; when she realizes Zorin abandoned her, she helps Bond remove the larger bomb, putting the device onto a handcar and riding it out of the mine, where it explodes and kills her.Escaping in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, Zorin abducts Stacey while Bond grabs hold of the airship's mooring rope. Zorin tries to knock him off, but Bond manages to moor the airship to the framework of the Golden Gate Bridge. Stacey attacks Zorin to save Bond, and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Stacey flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin follows them out with an ax. The ensuing fight between Zorin and Bond culminates with Zorin falling to his death. Mortner attempts to attack Bond with dynamite, but Bond cuts the airship free, causing Mortner to drop the dynamite in the cabin, blowing up the airship and killing himself and Scarpine.General Gogol wishes to award Bond the Order of Lenin for foiling Zorin's scheme, but M (Robert Brown) reports that he is missing. At Stacy's home, Q (Desmond Llewelyn) sends a remote-controlled surveillance robot in to search the residence, whereupon it discovers Bond in the bathroom with Stacey.",
