Two FBI agents (Kristen Harris and Erik Athavale) interrogate him about his identity, before Hutch responds that he's simply \"nobody\". Hutch feeds his cat from a can while he is in the interrogation room.In flashback, Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) leads an ordinary life with a strained marriage to Becca (Connie Nielsen), two children Blake (teenager) (Gage Munroe) & Abby (Paisley Cadorath) and an unremarkable office job.One night, some thieves (Lupita (Humberly Gonz√°lez) and Luis Martin (Edsson Morales)) break into his house with a gun. Hutch prepares to fight but relents and lets them leave. Blake had one of the thieves in his grip, and Hutch had the perfect opportunity to attack, as he picks up a golf club but does not swing. Instead, he asks Blake to let the thief go.\nEveryone thinks Hutch a failure for not fighting, but Hutch reveals to his brother Harry (RZA) that he held back because the burglars' gun was unloaded. Hutch and Harry speak over the radio hidden in Hutch's office.\nTo top it off, Hutch's neighbor pretends to be a tough guy, and rubs his Dodge Challenger in Hutch's face.Eddie Williams (Michael Ironside) is Hutch's father-in-law and his boss. Charlie (Billy MacLellan) is Eddie's son and Hutch's brother-in-law. He offers Hutch a gun for his own protection, which Hutch refuses and puts the gun in the office freezer. Hutch has given an offer to Eddie to buy out his business, but it's not a great offer. Eddie says that he built the factory from scratch and if he even considers selling, it has to be a great offer.It is revealed that Hutch used to work for the FBI. Hutch's father lives at an old age home and Hutch hides in past identity, papers and weapons in his father's closet.The following evening, Hutch's daughter reveals that her Kitty Cat bracelet is missing, and he sets out to find it. Hutch suspects the thieves from the previous night. He had seen the tattoo on one of thieves and finds the parlor where they got the tattoo. He finds their name and address. After tracking down the thieves, Hutch demands they return the bracelet, but he realizes they don't have it and leaves after seeing their sick baby drove them to crime.A group of drunk thugs get on a bus Hutch is taking and harass a young woman who was travelling on the bus. Hutch was looking to blow off his frustration and this presented the perfect opportunity. Hutch brutally beats them, after emptying the bus and then attacking the punks with anything that he can lay his hands on. Unbeknownst to him, the group's leader, Teddy (Aleksandr Pal), is the brother of Yulian Kuznetsov, a Russian crime lord. Hutch breaks Teddy's windpipe before performing a crude Cricothyroidotomy with a straw to allow him to breathe, although he falls into a coma and later dies of his wounds. Hutch is badly beaten up in the fight.Hutch returns home and is bandaged by Becca. Becca knows Hutch's past. He vents his frustrations about living a mundane life to her, before they reaffirm their love for one another.Yulian Kuznetsov (Aleksei Serebryakov), a Russian crime lord safeguarding the mob's Obshak (a common treasury used to settle disputes in the Russian mafia) money, who sends a crew to Hutch's home. Yulian was able to track Hutch via his metro card, which he dropped on the bus.\nYulian bribes a pentagon official to find out Hutch's past. He instructs his staff to bring in Hutch alive.Harry calls Hutch ahead and warns him that the men he attacked were connected to Yulian. He asks Hutch to check with The Barber (Colin Salmon), Hutch's former Government handler.\nWhen the capture team arrives, Hutch hides his family and kills most of the attackers. He is immobilized by an electric taser and taken by the Russian team. While being transported in the trunk of a car, Hutch finds and empties a canister of fire suppressant into the car. The driver crashes, killing all of the occupants, and freeing Hutch.\nHutch returns home and reveals that he is a former \"auditor\", an assassin employed by the United States Intelligence Community.While employed as an auditor Hutch set a target free, who reformed and lived happily with a new family. Wanting a similar life, Hutch retired.\nHutch sends his family to safety and retrieves his hidden gold and cash, then finds the bracelet under the couch all along. He burns his house down to dispose of the dead assassins and steals his neighbors classic Dodge Challenger.Meanwhile, two assassins come to his father David's (Christopher Lloyd) retirement home, but he is a retired agent himself. The assassins are swiftly taken out by the old man. Hutch uses the gold to buy his father in-law's metal fabrication factory and burns Yulian's Obshak money. He then proceeds to booby trap the entire factory.Hutch then visits Yulian and makes an offer to Yulian to end the fighting. Hutch says that Yulian attacked his family, and he burned down the Obshak. Yulian wants out as well as he cannot finance the entire Obshak. So, Hutch offers him a retirement in one of the lesser-known Caribbean Islands, away from the Russian mafia and Hutch will get his own life back.\nBut Yulian and his men pursue him to the factory and surround him. Suddenly his brother Harry (RZA) and father provide him with suppressing fire and the Russians are drawn into the factory.Using a variety of weapons and deadly traps that Hutch had prepared, Hutch kills them all. Harry and David survive the shootout, along with Hutch.Hutch is arrested but released with no charges filed thanks to a mysterious phone call. Three months later, while buying a new house with his wife, Hutch receives a call suggesting that his services are still required.\nDavid and Harry are shown carrying guns in their family caravan, presumably across the border.",
