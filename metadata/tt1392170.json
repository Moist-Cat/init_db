	"description": "The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, consists of a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer surrounding districts. As a punishment for a past rebellion, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by lottery (the \"Reaping\") to participate in the annual Hunger Games. The participants (or \"tributes\") must fight to the death in an arena; the sole survivor is rewarded with fame and wealth. In her very first Reaping, 12-year-old Primrose Everdeen is selected from District 12. Her older sister Katniss volunteers (Jennifer Lawrence) to take her place. Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), a baker's son who once gave Katniss bread when she was starving, is the other District 12 tribute. Katniss's boyfriend Gail feels strongly about the slaughter in the games & believes that if people stop watching, the Games will die naturally.Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol, where their drunken mentor, past victor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), advises them. He warns them about the \"Careers\" from Districts 1 and 2 who have trained intensively at special academies for the Games and who almost always win. He also says that minor objects in the game can mean the difference between life and death. Objects like food, water, fire can only be provided by sponsors & to get sponsors you need to get people to like you.There is a 2-week training & evaluation period where sponsors get to see the tribute's skills. Katniss is a strong and smart competitor & gathers sponsor attention by shooting an apple in their buffet, during evaluation. She gets a high score. President Snow tells Gamemaker Seneca Crane to contain Katniss, lest she controls the games.\nDuring an interview with TV personality Caesar Flickerman, Peeta unexpectedly reveals his love for Katniss. She is initially outraged, believing it to be a ploy to gain audience support, as \"sponsors\" may provide in-Games gifts of food, medicine, and tools. However, she discovers Peeta meant what he said.The Games begin with half of the tributes killed in the first few minutes; Katniss barely survives ignoring Haymitch's advice to run away from the melee around the tempting supplies and weapons strewn in front of a structure called the Cornucopia. Peeta forms an uneasy alliance with the Careers Cato, Clove, Marvel and Glimmer, and aids in the killing of the District 8 female tribute.\nKatniss tries to hide in the edges of the game & Crane pushes her back in by setting fire to the forest. Katniss is injured while escaping the raging flames. Haymitch convinces some sponsors to send some antibiotics to Katniss in the game to keep her alive.The Careers later find Katniss and chase her up a tree. A young girl from District 11 named Rue, hiding in a nearby tree, draws her attention to a poisonous Tracker Jaccker nest hanging from a branch. Katniss drops it on her sleeping besiegers. They all scatter, except for Glimmer, who is killed by the insects. Hallucinating due to Tracker Jacker venom, Katniss is warned to run away by Peeta. Rue cares for Katniss for a couple of days until she recovers.The alliance has gathered all the supplies into a pile. Katniss has Rue draw them off, then destroys the stockpile by setting off the mines the group had planted around it. Furious, Cato kills the District 3 boy assigned to guard it. Rue is fatally wounded by Marvel. Katniss kills Marvel, then comforts the dying Rue. Afterward, she gathers and arranges flowers around Rue's body. When this is televised, it sparks a riot in District 11. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) summons Seneca Crane, the Gamemaker, to express his displeasure at the way the Games are turning out.Since Katniss and Peeta have been presented to the public as \"star-crossed lovers\", Haymitch is able to convince Crane to make a rule change to avoid inciting further riots. It is announced that tributes from the same district can win as a pair. Upon hearing this, Katniss searches for Peeta and finds him with an infected sword wound in the leg. She portrays herself as deeply in love with him and gains the sponsor gift of soup. An announcer proclaims a feast, where the thing each survivor needs most will be provided. Peeta begs her not to risk getting him medicine.Katniss promises not to go, but after he falls asleep, she heads to the feast. Clove ambushes her and pins her down. As Clove gloats, Thresh, the other District 11 tribute, kills Clove after overhearing her tormenting Katniss about killing Rue. He spares Katniss \"just this time...for Rue\". The medicine works, keeping Peeta mobile.Foxface, the girl from District 5, who had survived by avoiding human contact, and stealing food from other tributes, dies from eating Nightlock berries she had stolen from Peeta; neither knowing they are highly poisonous. Crane unleashes a pack of hound-like creatures, called Mutations, to speed things up. They kill Thresh and force Katniss and Peeta to flee to the roof of the Cornucopia, where they encounter Cato. After a battle, Katniss wounds Cato with an arrow and Peeta hurls him to the creatures below. Katniss shoots Cato to spare him a prolonged death.With Peeta and Katniss apparently victorious, the rule change allowing two winners is suddenly revoked, forcing Peeta and Katniss to fight to the death. Peeta tells Katniss to shoot him. Instead, she gives him half of the Nightlock, realizing that killing themselves would deprive the people of a victor. However, before they can commit suicide, they are hastily proclaimed the victors of the 74th Hunger Games.Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made powerful enemies after her display of defiance. She and Peeta return to District 12, while Crane is locked in a room with a bowl of Nightlock berries, and President Snow considers the situation.",
