Marty wakes to young Lorraine looking seductively at Marty.Marty finds Doc & shows him the car to prove that he is from future. Doc promises Marty to get him back to 1985.

Already Marty can see his brother disappear from his wallet family photo.Marty has to get George & Lorraine together, but Lorraine loves Marty.

Marty drives the car & gets it to 88 mph, just as lightening strikes & gets back to 1985. He finds Doc who is on his back & is distraught. But Doc is OK as he was wearing a bullet proof vest based on Marty's note.George and Lorraine arrive home from a tennis match, happy and even a bit frisky.

Everyone starts barking about it until George shows them that Biff is waxing the car (a BMW) in the driveway. Biff comes into the house carrying a box filled with copies of George's first published book.",
