	"description": "Andromache of Scythia (\"Andy\") (Charlize Theron), Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts), Joe (Marwan Kenzari), and Nicky (Luca Marinelli) are centuries-old warriors with unexplained regenerative healing abilities who use their vast experience to work as mercenaries, taking missions that help people. Breaking their rule of never working for the same employers twice, they accept a job from former CIA operative James Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to rescue a group of kidnapped girls in South Sudan. Copley convinces Andy and Booker that the girls will be moved quickly by the kidnappers, and if they are they will never be found again.During the mission, which proves to be a ruse (as there were no hostages), they are ambushed and killed. After quickly recovering and killing their attackers, they realize that Copley set them up and remotely filmed their regeneration. Andy is now worried that the CIA knows about her team's regenerative abilities. She decides to kill Copley.Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, U.S. Marine Nile Freeman (KiKi Layne) has her throat slit while taking down a military target during a house search, only to recover without a scratch. Later, she shares a disturbing dream with the other immortals, who are then alerted to her existence, as they experience dreams of any new immortals until found. Andy is also perplexed as this is the first immortal find in over 200 years. Andy goes to extract Nile, while her team goes to a safe-house in France to track down Copley.Andy tracks down a confused Nile and extracts her from Afghanistan before military personnel can transfer her for further testing.\nCopley shows the video of the ambush to pharmaceutical executive Steven Merrick (Harry Melling), who sends operatives (led by Keane (Joey Ansah)) to capture the team. Dr Meta Kozak (Anamaria Marinca) is Merrick's head of research and wants to get her hands on a DNA sample to figure out how the immortals work.Andy brings Nile to a safe house in France (after Nile makes several attempts to escape, but finally accepts that Andy means no harm to her), where she meets the rest of their team. The group shares some of their past and reveal that they are not truly immortal: their ability to heal eventually stops, without warning, which happened to a previous immortal, Lykon. She is also told about the female immortal Quynh (Ngô Thanh Vân), the first of Andy's comrades, who was captured, accused of witchcraft, and lost to them when cast somewhere into the sea in an iron maiden, and has been continually drowning ever since for over 500 yrs now. The group searched for Quynh, but could never find her location.The group is ambushed by Merrick's forces; Joe and Nicky are captured (and taken by Copley to Merrick in a private jet) while a seemingly deceased Booker is left behind. While Booker regenerates, Andy kills all of their assailants but is wounded and realizes she is not healing.\nBooker locates Copley and Andy mounts an attack, while Nile separates from the group to reunite with her family (she says that she never had a choice in joining the immortals and cannot identify with them. Plus she wants to spend time with her family before they pass on).\nAndy and Booker confront Copley, only for Booker to betray Andy and shoot her, arguing that Merrick might find a way to end the immortality they have both grown weary of. As they are captured, however, Booker realizes that Andy is not healing. Copley has a change of heart when he sees that Merrick is willing to torture the immortals indefinitely to study them. Plus Merrick wants exclusivity on immortal DNA and thus will never release them back into the world.\nNile, having realized Booker sold out the group (when she checks her gun, it was without any bullets and she knows that the guns were handed by Booker), arrives too late to intervene, but she convinces Copley to assist her in a rescue mission. Copley says that he sold the immortals out due to her own wife's demise due to cancer. He thought he was giving a gift to the world by ending suffering.She storms Merrick's London office and after she frees the rest of the immortals, they fight their way out through the rest of Merrick's security (the whole team protects Andy and doesn't let any bullet get to her), with Nile saving Andy from Merrick by grabbing him and jumping out of a window, killing him.\nAs punishment for his betrayal, the group sentence Booker to loneliness - forbidding Booker from contacting them for 100 years. The rest of the group meets with Copley, who explains how his research revealed their past missions had a greater effect than they ever knew, with the descendants of people they had rescued going on to help the world in many different ways. With renewed faith in their existence, the group tasks Copley with maintaining their secret and finding missions where they can have an effect.\nSix months later in Paris, a depressed and drunken Booker is astonished to find Quynh in his apartment.",
