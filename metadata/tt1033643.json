	"description": "In New York City, high-strung equity trader Joy Ellis McNally (Cameron Diaz) is dumped by her fiance at a surprise birthday party she throws for him, because of her uptight attitude. At the same time, easy-going carpenter Jack Fuller (Ashton Kutcher) is fired from his job by his father, Jack Sr (Treat Williams). Both become emotionally distraught and, with best friends Toni \"Tipper\" Saxon (Lake Bell) who's a bartender, and Jeff \"Hater\" Lewis (Rob Corddry ), a lawyer, take a debauched trip to Las Vegas.Joy and Jack meet by chance when they are given the same hotel room because of a computer error. After clearing up the misunderstanding and receiving upgraded rooms and coupons to various clubs, they party and drink together and end up getting married. The next morning, they realize it was a mistake and decide to divorce.Before they do so, Jack uses a quarter Joy gives him in a slot machine. He hits a three million dollar jackpot and Joy reminds Jack that they are married and hence, she is entitled to half of the money. The couple return to New York, where they attempt to divorce. The judge declares that the couple cannot divorce until they attempt to co-exist for six months, while attending weekly sessions with Dr. Twitchell (Queen Latifah), a marriage counselor. If they work at the marriage but still want to divorce after six months, each will be permitted to keep half the winnings. If either party does not cooperate, the money will be tied up in litigation by the judge. They both learn that if one of them asks to get out of the marriage, the other will get the money. So they each try to drive the other to want to get out of the marriage.The newlyweds devise more and more cunning schemes to undermine each other, such as Jack telling Joy that their counseling session is canceled to prove she's not committed, and Joy inviting girls to their apartment to try to get Jack to cheat on her, throwing a party where Jack's friend Dave (Zach Galifianakis) shows up. Jack gives Joy's ex-fiance, Mason (Jason Sudeikis), her engagement ring back without Joy knowing. However, at Joy's job retreat, Jack and Joy find themselves developing an unexpected attraction to one another, and they soon realize that being with each other has brought out the best in both of them.After they get back from the retreat, it's time for the judge to decide what happens to the money. On her way to the hearing, Joy sees her ex-fiance Mason, and he tells her that he wants her back. He gives her back the engagement ring and tells her that she is good enough for him. Joy realizes that Jack set her up to get back with Mason and cheat on Jack so that they will be divorced. Joy walks away from Mason and goes to the hearing. At the hearing, their marriage counselor testifies that the couple tried to work on their marriage. The judge decides that they will split the remaining 1.4 million dollars (after taxes, bills Joy ran up, and money Jack spent on his new woodworking business). Joy tells the judge she doesn't want any of the money and as she leaves she gives the engagement ring to Jack, telling him she doesn't want anything from him.Joy gets the promotion she'd been working for, but declines it, telling her boss she would rather be happy doing nothing than doing something she hates and being miserable. Jack's parents tell him they think it looks like he and Joy are in love. Realizing his mistake, he goes to find her. Tipper tells Jack that she quit her job and that nobody knows where she is. He suspects that she has gone to a beach (Fire Island, New York) that she told him about as the only place that makes her feel truly happy. Finding her, Jack asks her to be his wife (again) and she says yes.Epilogue\nDuring the closing credits, there are scenes from the day Jack and Joy get married, of Tipper and Hater subsequently enacting a plan of revenge on Mason, and of Hater cutting off Dave.",
