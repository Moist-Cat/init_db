	"description": "A fox named Tod quickly becomes friends with a hound named Copper and they are instantly growing close with each other. Unfortunate for them, they are on opposite sides of the fence with Tod living with a kindly widowed farmer and Copper living with an unscrupulous hunter who wants to train him to become a hunting dog. As time passes, their relationship is put to the test when Copper's owner sets out to shoot Tod for almost killing his other dog, Chief. With that, there are consequences ahead.",
