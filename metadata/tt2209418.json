	"description": "Nine years after the conclusion of Before Sunset, Jesse and Celine live in Paris as a couple, parents to twin girls conceived when they got together. Jesse is also struggling to maintain his relationship with his teenage son Hank, who lives in Chicago with Jesse's (now) ex-wife and who, after spending the summer with Jesse and Celine on a Greek island, is being dropped off at the airport to fly home. Jesse has continued to find success as a novelist, while Celine is at a career crossroads, considering a job in government.When Jesse drops his son, Henry (\"Hank\") off at the airport, he promises to visit him in the near future so he can see him perform at a school music recital. Henry is reluctant and tries to discourage his father from coming because it will upset his mother. Henry says he isn't worried about his mother getting upset about she & his father meeting face-to-face, but is worried about how it will effect himself. Jesse is left feeling confused. Outside the terminal, Jesse meets up with Celine and the two get in their car and drive home. As the camera pulls back from the driver's seat, we see that Jesse and Celine have twin daughters.",
