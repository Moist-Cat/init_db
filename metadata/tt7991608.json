	"description": "Two thousand years ago, Marcus Antonius gifted Cleopatra three bejeweled eggs as a wedding gift symbolizing his devotion. The eggs were lost to time until two are found by a farmer in 1907, the third remaining lost.In 2021, Special Agent John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson), a criminal Profiler for the FBI is assigned to assist Interpol agent Urvashi Das (Ritu Arya) in investigating the theft of one of the eggs kept on display at the Museo Nazionale Di Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome. He determines the egg on display is a forgery and the real egg has been stolen, so Das has the room locked down. However, before the room is sealed shut, international art thief Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds) manages to escape, pursued by Hartley. A chase ensues, but Booth is more than a match for Hartley.Booth eventually escapes to his home in Bali with the egg, but finds Hartley waiting for him, along with Das and an Interpol strike team. They arrest Booth and take the egg into custody. Unbeknownst to anyone else, Booth's main competition, Sarah Black AKA \"The Bishop\" (Gal Gadot) is disguised as one of the strike team members and swaps the real egg with another forgery in the back of the vehicle. The next day, Das confronts Hartley (she says FBI has no record of Hartley and that Hartley received a $8 MM payment from an encrypted account the same day the egg was stolen in Bali) believing he's responsible for the egg's theft. As a result, she has him incarcerated in a remote Russian prison in the same cell as Booth.\nBooth tells Hartley about an Egyptian Billionaire who is offering $300 MM for all 3 eggs.Shortly after arrival, they are brought to Black where she proposes to Booth they work together to find the third egg, revealing to Hartley that he does in fact know of its whereabouts. Booth declines her modest offer, and she departs stating she'll find the second egg; when she does, she warns that his share will be less. Hartley suggests he and Booth work together to beat Black. If Booth helps him imprison Black then Booth will take her place as the number one art thief in the world.The pair escape from prison and head to Valencia to steal the second egg, in the possession of notorious arms dealer Sotto Voce (Chris Diamantopoulos) who is having a masquerade ball. There, they encounter Black, who also intends to steal it. The three arrive in Voce's vault (before that Hartley saves Booth from Das, as she was also at the party, wanting to arrest them both. Throughout the escapade, Hartley is shown to be trying to win Booth's trust) where Hartley and Booth fight Black using a variety of melee weapons on display in the vault before she handcuffs them together. Voce arrives with his security detail and apprehends the men while Black reveals she and Voce are working together (Black had warned Voce that Hartley and Booth would try to steal his egg).\nHartley also maintains to Booth that he does not care about the 3rd egg, he just wants to capture Black, so that he can clear his own name and get his life back.They torture Hartley and, believing Booth has divulged the location of the third egg, Black double-crosses Voce and leaves for Egypt (a secret chamber in the Pyramid of Giza, which belonged to Cleopatra) where Booth claims it is. After leaving Valencia, Booth reveals to Hartley that the egg is in fact in Argentina, a location only he knows as it was inscribed on his late father's beloved watch which had once belonged to Adolf Hitler's personal art curator Rudolph Zeich. After the Third Reich fell in 1945, Zeich fled Europe for Argentina with the egg. The duo search the jungles of Argentina where they find a secret bunker. Inside are countless Nazi artifacts, among them the third egg.Black arrives to steal the egg from the duo at gunpoint, only to be interrupted by the arrival of Das and a team of local police. Hartley, Booth, and Black escape in an antique Mercedes, driving through an abandoned copper mine near the bunker, being chased by Das in an armored vehicle. Eventually, they exit near the top of a waterfall which they jump, landing in a lake at the bottom. Booth swims to shore with the egg, only to discover that Hartley and Black are actually romantic and professional partners, both going by the alias \"Bishop\". Booth surrenders the egg and they leave him handcuffed to a tree in the rain-forest.In Cairo, Hartley and Black deliver the three eggs to an Egyptian billionaire buyer, in time for his daughter's wedding (mirroring Marc Antony's original gift to Cleopatra). The gesture is overshadowed when the bride is more excited by the wedding singer Ed Sheeran. The wedding is subsequently interrupted by Das' Interpol raid. Alone on their yacht, Hartley and Black are met again by Booth who informs them that he told Das about their Cayman Islands account containing the $300 million payout from the Egyptian billionaire, which Das freezes. Booth also reveals that Interpol is on their way to capture them, but offers them a chance to escape if they help him with a new heist, which requires three individuals to pull off. They agree and escape, and Das places red notices on all three of them as they begin their heist at The Louvre in Paris.",
