	"description": "Bond (Roger Moore) destroys a LATAM secret missile & radar base. Bond is actually captured while trying to plant a bomb. He escapes and uses a small fold-able jet, that he smuggled near the base in a horse carriage. He then brings a SAM missile fired at him to the base and uses the SAM to destroy the entire facility.\nWhile trying to escape from East to West Berlin, British agent 009 dies (after being attacked by 2 knife wielding twins) in the residence of the British Ambassador, dressed as a circus clown and carrying a fake Fabergé egg. MI6 immediately suspects Soviet involvement (maybe to raise foreign currency) and, after seeing the real egg appear at an auction in London, sends James Bond (Roger Moore) to identify the seller.\nMiss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) & Penelope Smallbone (Michaela Clavell), Moneypenny's assistant. Jim Fanning (Douglas Wilmer), antiquities expert who accompanies Bond at the Fabergé auction. Frederick Gray (Geoffrey Keen): The British Minister of Defence.Soviet Chairman (Paul Hardwick), presides over meeting between Orlov and Gogol. Gogol supports mutual disarmament between US and Soviet Russia, while Orlov thinks this is a meek surrender. Orlov wants to use his offensive forces on the Eastern front and use numerical superiority to gain territory. But Gogol says NATO will respond with nuclear strikes.\nMeanwhile Orlov is informed of the stolen fake egg and decides to inform London to stop the auction (confirming he is the seller and now he does not have the fake to replace the real one in the Russian treasury). But the auction is already underway.At the auction, Bond swaps the real egg for a fake one and subsequently engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan) (who gets a message during the auction (presumably from Orlov, to buy the egg at any cost). Kamal is usually a seller at Sotheby's), forcing Khan to pay £500,000 for the fake egg (When the estimate was 250-300K Pounds). Bond follows Khan back to his palace in Rajasthan (although, in-story dialogue establishes the setting as Delhi), where Bond defeats Khan in a game of backgammon (He had noticed Khan was cheating). Bond also reveals to Khan that he has the Fabrege egg, making him wonder which one is real.\nBond escapes with his contact Vijay (Vijay Amritraj), foiling the attempts of Khan's bodyguard Gobinda (Kabir Bedi) to kill the pair. Bond is seduced by Khan's associate Magda (Kristina Wayborn), and notices that she has a blue-ringed octopus tattoo. Bond permits Magda to steal the real Fabergé egg, fitted with listening and tracking devices by Q (Desmond Llewelyn), while Gobinda captures and takes Bond to Khan's palace. Meanwhile Khan takes the egg to Octopussy's palace. Octopussy wants Bond to delivered to her.\nAfter Bond escapes from his room, he listens in on the bug and discovers that Khan is working with Orlov (Steven Berkoff), a Soviet general, who is seeking to expand Soviet control in Europe. Bond escapes Khan's palace by replacing a dead body being transported out.. Khan and Gobinda pursue in an tiger hunt, with Bond being the target, but he manages to escape by emulating Tarzan..Bond meets Vijay and Sadruddin (Albert Moses), head of MI6 station in India, assigned to assist Bond. They tell him that the octopus tattoo on Magda is from Octopussy.\nBond infiltrates a floating palace in Udaipur, and there finds its owner, Octopussy (Maud Adams), a wealthy businesswoman, smuggler and associate of Khan. She also leads the Octopus cult, of which Magda is a member. Octopussy has a personal connection with Bond: she is the daughter of the late Major Dexter-Smythe, whom Bond was assigned to arrest for treason. Bond allowed the Major to commit suicide rather than face trial, and Octopussy thanks him for offering her father an honorable alternative, inviting Bond to stay on as her guest.\nEarlier in Khan's palace and later in Octopussy's palace, Bond finds out that Orlov has been supplying Khan with priceless Soviet treasures, replacing them with replicas while Khan has been smuggling the real versions into the West via Octopussy's circus troupe. Orlov is planning to meet Khan at Karl-Marx-Stadt (Chemnitz) in East Germany, where the circus is scheduled to perform.\nGobinda sends mercenaries to kill Bond, but he and Octopussy gain the upper hand when the assassins break into the palace. Bond learns from Q that Vijay has been killed by the goons.Travelling to East Germany, Bond infiltrates the circus at Karl-Marx-Stadt and finds out that Orlov (in cahoots with Khan and Gobinsa. Octopussy was not aware of the nuclear bomb plan which would kill her entire circus troupe) has replaced the Soviet treasures with a nuclear warhead (100 KT yield, similar to a US medium yield bomb), primed to explode during the circus show at a US Air Force base in West Germany (where the circus is scheduled to perform next). The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking unilateral disarmament in the belief that the bomb was a US one that detonated by accident, leaving its borders open to a Soviet invasion. Bond takes Orlov's car (Orlov escapes on another train but the real jewels are in the trunk of the car with Bond), drives it along the train tracks and boards the moving circus train. The car is smashed by an oncoming train and later discovered by Gogol, with the jewels in the boot.\nOrlov gives chase to Bond, but is killed at the border by East German guards after they mistake Orlov for a defector. Bond kills the twin knife-throwing assassins Mischka (David Meyer) and Grischka (Anthony Meyer) and, after falling from the train, commandeers a car to get to the airbase. Bond penetrates the base and disguises himself as a clown to evade the West German police.\nHe attempts to convince Octopussy that Khan has betrayed her by showing her one of the treasures found in Orlov's car, which she was to smuggle for him. Octopussy realizes that she has been tricked, and assists Bond in deactivating the warhead.Bond and Octopussy return separately to India. Bond arrives at Khan's palace just as Octopussy and her troops have launched an assault on the grounds. Octopussy attempts to kill Khan, but is captured by Gobinda. While Octopussy's team, led by Magda, overpower Khan's guards, Khan and Gobinda abandon the palace, taking Octopussy as a hostage. Bond pursues them as they attempt to escape in their plane, clinging to the fuselage and disabling the ailerons and elevator panels. In the subsequent struggle with Bond, Gobinda takes a deadly plummet off the roof of the plane and Bond rescues Octopussy from Khan, the pair jumping onto a nearby cliff only seconds before the plane crashes into a mountain, killing Khan.\nWhile M (Robert Brown) and General Gogol (Walter Gotell) discuss the transport of the jewelry, Bond recuperates with Octopussy aboard her private boat in India.",
