	"description": "West Virginian Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) is laid off from his construction job in the tunnels underneath the Charlotte Motor Speedway (he is told that he didn't declare a possibly limp in his legs on his hiring paperwork, and that's a breach of contract due to a contingent liability for the company). He is close to his daughter, Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie), who lives with his ex-Bobbie Jo (Katie Holmes), Bobbie Jo's husband Moody (David Denman), and their two sons (Sadie's half-brothers). Sadie performs in beauty pageants, and Jimmy's hair stylist sister, Mellie (Riley Keough), does her hair. Bobbie Jo and Moody plan on moving to Lynchburg as Moody plans to open up a new dealership (Moody owns several car dealerships). Jimmy is against this, as Lynchburg is across state lines and Jimmy will have to driver further, just to have his days with Sadie.Jimmy is short on cash and behind on his phone bills, due to which his cell phone is often disconnected by the phone companies.Jimmy goes to the Duck Tape Grill & Bar, where his brother, Clyde (Adam Driver), tends bar. Clyde, a war veteran and amputee missing the lower part of his left arm, believes the Logan family is cursed. A NASCAR-team owner, Max Chilblain (Seth MacFarlane) (a pretentious British businessman who has created a drink called \"To the Max\". He sponsors down-on-his-luck driver Dayton White), enters the bar with two friends and makes fun of Clyde's disability. Jimmy defends his brother and starts a fight; Clyde grabs a bottle from the bar and heads outside to set Max's car on fire. Max and his friends run outside to see the car burning and start filming the scene. Jimmy grabs their phones and throws them into the fire, then turns to Clyde and says \"cauliflower.\" The last time Jimmy said Cauliflower, Clyde went to prison for 6 months.The next day Jimmy tells Clyde his plan to rob the Speedway by exploiting his knowledge of the underground pneumatic tube system used to move the Speedway's vast amount of money. The tube system moves money from the various cash registers into the bank vault at the center of the speedway.Clyde and Jimmy recruit a team for the robbery: Their sister Mellie, incarcerated safe-cracker Joe Bang (Daniel Craig), and, at Joe's request, Joe's dimwitted brothers Sam (Brian Gleeson) and Fish (Jack Quaid). Sam and Fish are initially reluctant to join the team, claiming they are \"living with the Lord\" and therefore need a moral reason to break the law. Joe was not convinced to partake, but buys in when Clyde tells him that Fish told his wife Misty about the stash of cash from Joe's last bust. The next day, Misty dug up the cash and ran away with some truck driver to Florida.The bank vault's alarms are turned off, due to all the construction work going on at the speedway. The plan is to get Joe out of prison, in broad daylight, do the job and then bring Joe back to the prison before anyone notices that he is gone.\nClyde and Jimmy tell the brothers the event they'll be robbing is sponsored by the Grocery Castle, and Clyde mentions that Mellie used to work at the Grocery Castle outside Manila before the assistant manager got \"handsy.\" Sam and Fish agree to the robbery because of \"the whole morality thing.\"Clyde gets himself intentionally sent to prison on a minor charge (He runs his car into a gas station store). The plan is to break Joe and Clyde out of prison for the robbery and return them to prison later in the day; Joe recruits an inmate to orchestrate a riot on the day of the robbery as a distraction. With the (unknowing) help of a woman working in the vault, Mellie, Sam, and Fish infest the Speedway's tube system with painted cockroaches to determine which tubes lead to the vault. While gathering supplies, Jimmy meets former schoolmate Sylvia Harrison (Katherine Waterston), who comments on his injury from the bar fight and gives him a free tetanus shot inside her mobile clinic. Later, Jimmy sees his former boss and learns that construction at the speedway is being completed ahead of schedule. This forces them to move the heist up by a week, which means they'll now be robbing the Speedway during the much busier Coca-Cola 600 race on Memorial Day weekend.On the day of the robbery, the inmate recruited by Joe starts a fight which results in a lock-down. Joe (who was in the infirmary for vomiting) and Clyde escape by concealing themselves under one of the outgoing prison trucks. Due to the lock-down, all doors are locked, and the nurse cannot enter the infirmary. Joe and Clyde get out from a secret tunnel in the bathroom.Mellie meets them at a gas station in a Ford Shelby GT350 that she \"borrowed\" from Moody. At the speedway, Sam and Fish blow up a generator to disable the credit card machines, forcing vendors to accept cash only. Clyde, Jimmy, and Joe enter the tube room, and Joe uses an explosive improvised from bleach, gummy bears, and a dietary salt substitute to blow open the gate from the tube to the vault. They connect the tube to a giant vacuum pump and suck up all the cash into garbage bags. Security guards investigate the smoke from the explosion, but are diverted by Earl (Charles Halford), one of Clyde's bar patrons. Jimmy accidentally reverses the direction of the vacuum, sucking Clyde's prosthetic arm into the machine. Sam and Fish get the money out and into Jimmy's truck. As they are leaving through the tunnels, Clyde and Joe run into Chilblain, who is in the middle of an argument with his race-car driver Dayton White (Sebastian Stan). Chilblain vaguely recognizes Clyde, who hits him.Back at the prison, the prisoners take several guards captive in the cafeteria and demand the last three A Song of Ice and Fire novels from the warden. The warden Burns (Dwight Yoakam) explains that this is impossible, as the series' author George R. R. Martin has yet to write the last two novels. This relatively peaceful standoff ends when one of the prisoners starts a fire in a trash can and sets off the smoke alarm, forcing the warden to finally call the fire department. Clyde and Joe sneak back into the prison disguised as firefighters.Jimmy makes it to his daughter's pageant just in time to see her perform his favorite song, \"Take Me Home, Country Roads.\" Jimmy then abandons the money, in the pickup truck (packed inside garbage bags), at a gas station and anonymously informs the police of its location.FBI agent Sarah Grayson (Hilary Swank) investigates the heist, dubbed \"Ocean's Seven-Eleven\" in the press. She suspects Jimmy, Clyde, and Joe, but has no evidence. Chilblain claims he saw Clyde at the Speedway, but White is angry about wrecking during the race thanks to a sugar crash caused by Chilblain's energy drink and refuses to corroborate Chilblain's story. The prison warden wants to maintain the illusion that the prison has no problems under his leadership and refuses to report the riot, claiming there were no problems at the prison on the day of the robbery other than a small kitchen fire. The money was recovered in a truck behind a gas station.\nAfter six months, the Speedway receives an insurance payout (for the not recovered part of the cash) and is satisfied with the amount; the case is officially closed as Grayson's team has made no arrests and the locals view the thieves as \"some type of Hee-Haw heroes.\"Joe then finds a garbage bag full of money buried in his back yard. Sylvia receives an anonymous donation for her mobile clinic, the inmate who started the riot receives an envelope stuffed with cash, and the unwitting bank employee receives a cake box full of cash. Jimmy, Clyde, and Mellie filled another set of trash bags while Joe and his brothers were stuck at the gate (which Jimmy hijacked with a West Virginia magnet) trying to drive the first set of bags to Jimmy's truck. The second set of bags was hidden at the dump (with the help of Earl) to be retrieved later. Jimmy knew the case had been closed when his phone service was finally cut off: He knew the phone company wouldn't cut his service so long as the FBI wanted to tap his line. Once the coast was clear, Jimmy, Clyde, and Earl went to retrieve the money.The movie ends with Jimmy, who now works at a Lowe's store near his daughter and ex-wife's home in Lynchburg, happily reuniting with the crew (and Sylvia, with whom he is now in a relationship) at Clyde's bar. The group is watched by Grayson, who does a shot with Clyde and tells him she's new to the area but thinks she will stay for a while.",
