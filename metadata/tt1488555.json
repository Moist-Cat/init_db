	"description": "Mitch and Dave are best friends who have grown up together. Their lives have taken different paths. Dave is a successful but stressed lawyer, husband and father of 3 children. Mitch, on the other hand, is a single man and responsibility-free. One night, after much drinking, they arrive at a fountain to urinate. They remark that they wish they had each others life. Unbeknownst to them, it is a wishing fountain. The next day, they awake to find that they are in each others body. Now living each others life, they soon discover that the grass is not greener. They go back to find the fountain, only to find that it has been moved. Stuck in their situation, Mitch needs to go to Dave's law firm with some important documents. Dave needs to attend a film shoot for Mitch, only to find that it is a softcore porn movie. They try their best to avoid messing up each others lives while they find a way back to their own.",
