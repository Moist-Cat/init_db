	"description": "After winning the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) return home to District 12. Katniss still loves Gale, who now works in the mines, but she is till traumatized by the incidents during the Hunger Games. Katniss tries to convince Gale that her love for Peeta was an act, but he is not convinced. She says that she did what she had to do to survive.\nKatniss lives in the Victor's village with Peeta and Haymitch.President Snow (Donald Sutherland) visits Katniss and explains that her actions in the Games (her threat to consumer the poisonous berries along with Peeta) have inspired rebellions across the districts. He orders her to use the upcoming victory tour to convince everyone her actions were out of genuine love for Peeta, not defiance against the Capitol. Snow threatens the destruction of District 12, with thousands of people dead, if Katniss does not comply. Snow reveals that he knows about Katniss's relationship with Gale.\nEffie is sent to take charge of preparing Katniss and Peeta for their victory tour. Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) hosts the victory tour special on TV and brings their love story to the masses. Cinna is now a fashion super star due to the flaming dress wore by Katniss and has been roped as the fashion consultant for the tour. During the tour they will visit all 12 districts in 12 days.As the tour begins, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), mentor to Katniss and Peeta, warns them that the \"show\" of their relationship must continue for the rest of their lives.\nStill, the districts greet Katniss with her trademark Mockingjay salute and tune, as a show of defiance against the Capitol. At district 11, the Capitol eliminates protesters who participate in the salute. This shocks Katniss, who decides to stick to the script at all remaining districts, as she doesn't want any more deaths on her hands. The crowds want to hear what she really thinks.\nSnow is alarmed when he finds that his own granddaughter is wearing her hear in Katniss's hair style.\nHaymitch knows that Snow is not buying the tour, and they need to convince Snow that their love is real. Katniss suggests a public engagement between herself and Peeta, which is carried out and congratulated by Snow at his mansion in the Capitol. Peeta and Katniss see how the Capitol lives in opulence and excess, while people starve in the Districts.Returning home, Katniss warns her friend Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hensworth) of Snow's threat to kill both their families. Katniss knows that Snow is not convinced with the tour and will crack down her and Gale. Katniss wants to run away with Gale, but before she can, the Peacekeepers arrive. Gale refuses to run away as he is worried about the people who stay behind. Gale is adamant that the people want to fight the Capitol.\nPeacekeepers crack down on District 12 and Gale is publicly whipped after attacking new Head Peacekeeper Romulus Thread (Patrick St. Esprit). Katniss tries to save Gale and is roughed up by Thread. Haymitch intervenes and saves Katniss by explaining to Thread that he will have to answer to Snow if Katniss does not attend her own wedding due to his actions.Snow announces a special Hunger Games, the Third Quarter Quell, where all tributes will be selected from previous victors in each District. He does this because he knows that the districts see all previous victors, including Katniss, as rays of hope in their uprising against the capitol. The districts are already in a state of riot after the victory tour, and Snow needs a way to bring things back under control.\nThe new head Gamemaker Plutarch Havensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), advice Snow to eliminate all victors by conducting the games.Katniss immediately devotes herself to ensuring Peeta survives, recruiting Haymitch's help to do so. At the reaping, Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) draws Katniss and Haymitch's names, but Peeta immediately volunteers to take Haymitch's place.As they prepare, Haymitch reveals that all the tributes are angry at being returned to the Games and advises a reluctant Katniss to make allies. Tributes include Cashmere (Stephanie Leigh Schlund) and Gloss (Alan Ritchson), from district 1. Brutus (Bruno Gunn) and Enobaria (Meta Golding), Enobaria had her teeth filed so it is easier for her to rip human flesh. Wiress and Beetee, real tech savvy. Finnick Odair, youngest winner of the games at 14 years of age. Mags is Finnick's mentor and raised him. Johanna Mason is a fireball from district 7, who tries to break up Katniss and Peeta by hitting on Peeta.In the Pre-Games interviews, Katniss wears her wedding dress, as ordered by President Snow, but her stylist Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) rigs it to transform into a representation of a Mockingjay. As punishment, Cinna is later severely beaten by Peacekeepers before a helpless Katniss is sent into the arena.\nThe victors all want the games to be stopped and all of them express their rage and frustration on live TV. Peeta announces that they are expecting a baby which causes outrage and the audience of Capitol citizens to begin shouting for the Games to be stopped. But Snow still makes the games go ahead.In the Games, Katniss allies with Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and the elderly Mags (Lynn Cohen), from District 4. A group called \"The Career Pack\" (including Cashmere, Gloss, Brutus and Enobaria) occupies the main supply base at the center of the arena and the Katniss group is forced to take shelter in the surrounding forest.\nThe arena's outer force-field shocks Peeta, stopping his heartbeat until Finnick revives him. The group flees a poisonous fog, and Mags sacrifices herself so as to avoid slowing them down. When vicious mandrills attack, Peeta is saved by the unexpected sacrifice of a tribute from District 6.\nThe group escapes to a beach and meets District 3's Wiress (Amanda Plummer) and Beetee (Jeffrey Wright), and District 7's Johanna Mason (Jena Malone).\nJohanna tells about how her group was surprised by a rain of blood, causing them to become blinded, and one tribute getting killed by an electrical force-field. The group subsequently witnesses a large flooding, killing an unknown tribute in one section on the other side of the jungle. Wiress discovers the arena is designed like a clock with regular hazards each hour but is killed soon after in a battle.Beetee suggests using one of the hazards, a tree that is struck by lightning every 12 hours, and a coil of wire to electrocute the Career Group. The group separates to prepare the trap, but once alone Johanna appears to attack Katniss - in reality cutting the tracker (installed by Capitol) from Katniss' arm.\nKatniss returns to the tree and finds an unconscious Beetee with the wire from the tree attached to a makeshift spear. Unable to find Peeta, Katniss almost attacks Finnick, but Finnick reminds her to consider \"who the real enemy is\", as Haymitch had advised her prior to the Games. Katniss attaches the remaining wire to an arrow and shoots it into the arena force-field as the lightning hits, causing a power failure that takes down the dome's force-field as well as the Capitol's surveillance.\nPresident Snow enters the game room demanding answers, only to find that the game is off the air and Heavensbee is gone.Katniss awakens in an aircraft to find Haymitch, Beetee, Finnick, and Plutarch Heavensbee, the head Gamemaker, who is revealed to be a rebel against Snow. He tells her they are bound for District 13, headquarters of the new rebellion, and that half the tributes were aware of the plan to escape with Katniss, as a symbol for the growing rebellion.\nThey were unable to rescue Peeta and Johanna, who were taken by the Capitol. A distraught Katniss is sedated after attacking Haymitch. She later awakens to find Gale by her side, who reassures that her family is safe but tells her District 12 was destroyed.",
