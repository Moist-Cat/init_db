	"description": "In 1987, Janet Van Dyne / Wasp (Michelle Pfeiffer) shrinks between the molecules of a Soviet nuclear missile, disabling it but becoming trapped in the sub-atomic quantum realm. Hank was with Janet, but his regulator malfunctioned preventing him from going sub-atomic, and thus Janet had to step up to stop the missile from exploding.\nHank Pym / Ant-Man (Michael Douglas) (A former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, entomologist, and physicist who became the original Ant-Man after discovering the subatomic particles that make the transformation possible) raises their daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) believing that Janet is dead.Years later, former criminal Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) takes up the mantle of Ant-Man and discovers a way to both enter and return from the quantum realm. Pym and Hope begin work on repeating this feat, believing they may find Janet alive. Pym starts building a Quantum tunnel which would allow a person to enter and exit the Quantum realm.\nLang and Hope also start a romantic relationship and begin training to fight together as Ant-Man and the Wasp, until Lang secretly helps Captain America during a skirmish between the Avengers in violation of the Sokovia Accords. Lang makes a deal with the Department of Defense and is allowed to return home in exchange for 2 years of house arrest (followed by 3 years of probation), while Pym and Hope go into hiding and cut ties with Lang.\nAs per the deal, Lang cannot be in touch with Pym or Hope. Any violation of the deal means 20 years in prison for Lang.\nLang spends time at home with his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) and his business associate Luis (Michael Pena).Two years later, Pym and Hope briefly manage to open a tunnel to the quantum realm. Lang receives an apparent message from Janet with whom he is quantum state entangled. The message was in form of a dream that Lang gets while sleeping.\nDespite having only days left of house arrest; Lang decides to call Pym. Hope kidnaps Lang, leaving a giant ant as a decoy (wearing Lang's leg brace) so as not to arouse suspicion from FBI agent Jimmy Woo (Randall Park).\nSeeing the message as confirmation that Janet is alive (In the dream Janet was playing hide and seek with little Hope. Hope was hiding in a closet, which had horses on it and this was the same place where she hid every time), Pym and Hope work to create a stable tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve Janet. Hope arranges to buy a part needed for the tunnel from black market dealer Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins), but Burch has realized the potential profit that can be earned from Pym and Hope's research and double-crosses them & refuses to sell the part to Hope unless she makes him partner in their research.Hope fights Burch and his men off, until she is attacked by a quantum state unstable masked woman. Lang tries to help fight off this \"ghost\", but she escapes with Pym's portable lab (Pym designed a full-sized building as his lab, but then shrank it so that he could carry it around like luggage).Pym cannot locate the lab as he needs his equipment, and all his equipment is inside the lab.\nPym reluctantly visits his estranged former partner Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne) (An old friend of Pym who was once his assistant on Project Goliath) who helps them locate the lab. Foster went as big as 21 feet in experiments back in his day, while Lang claims that he went to 65 feet in Berlin. Foster claims that Pym drove everyday away due to his ego, and only Janet could stick with him, and she paid the price for that by getting stuck in the Quantum realm.Pym and Hope implement the idea of using the regulator on Lang's old suit to find the lab and it works.\nThe ghost restrains Lang, Hope, and Pym when they arrive, and reveals herself to be Ava Starr (Hannah John-Kamen). Her father Elihas was another former partner of Pym's and they worked together at SHEILD. Pym had Elihas discredited and fired. Elihas was desperate to earn his reputation back and he started conducting Quantum experiments at home. He accidentally killed himself and his wife during a quantum experiment that caused Ava's unstable state of molecular Disequilibrium. This means that every cell in her body is torn apart and stitched back together every day.She was discovered alive after the blast and handed over to SHEILD. SHEILD converted Ava in a weapon, and she did what she was asked, against the promise of a cure. But SHEILD lied and when it collapsed, Foster stepped in.\nFoster reveals that he has been helping Ava (Foster built Ava a containment chamber to slow her decay, but hasn't succeeded), who they plan to cure using Janet's quantum energy.\nBelieving that this will kill Janet, Pym refuses to help them and the trio manage to escape.Opening a stable version of the tunnel this time, Pym and Hope are able to contact Janet, who gives them a precise location to find her, but warns that they only have two hours before the unstable nature of the realm separates them for a century. Burch learns their location from Lang's business partners Luis (Michael Peña), Dave (Tip \"T.I.\" Harris), and Kurt (David Dastmalchian), and informs a contact at the FBI. Luis warns Lang, who rushes home before Woo can see him breaking his house arrest. This leaves Pym and Hope to be arrested by the FBI, and for their lab to be taken by Ava.Lang is soon able to help Pym and Hope escape custody, and they find the lab (through A new tracker that Pym installed when he got the lab back briefly). Lang and Hope distract Ava while Pym enters the quantum realm to retrieve Janet, but the pair end up fighting Burch and his men, which allows Ava to enter the lab and then enter the quantum realm and to begin taking Janet's energy. Luis, Dave, and Kurt help apprehend Burch, so Lang and Hope can stop Ava. Pym and Janet arrive safely from the quantum realm, and Janet voluntarily gifts some of her energy to Ava to temporarily stabilize her.Lang returns home once again, in time for a now suspicious Woo to release him at the end of his house arrest. Ava and Foster go into hiding.\nIn a mid-credits scene, Pym, Lang, Hope, and Janet plan to harvest quantum energy to continue helping Ava. While Lang is in the quantum realm doing this, Pym, Hope, and Janet disintegrate.",
