	"description": "In Russia, the news details Stark Industries CEO Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) revealing his identity as Iron Man to the world. Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), whose father Anton Vanko (Yevgeni Lazarev) has just died, sees this and begins building an arc reactor similar to Stark's.\nAnton tells Ivan before dying, that all he could give Ivan was his knowledge and that it should have been Ivan on the TV instead of Tony. Ivan had access to some old blueprints for the Arc reactor and they had 2 names on it, Howard Stark and Anton Vanko.Six months later, Stark has used his Iron Man armor to help maintain world peace. He re-institutes the Stark Expo in Flushing Meadows to continue his father Howard's legacy. The last time Stark Expo was held before was in 1974. Stark had access to some of Howard's old, recorded videos where he talks about the city of the future.\nSenator Stern (Garry Shandling) demands that Stark turn over the Iron Man technology to the government. Stark's rival Justin Hammer (and the current primary defense contractor to the military) and his military liaison Colonel James Rhodes are also invited to the Senate hearing to testify. Stern reveals images showing that foreign nations are well on their way to developing their own Iron Man systems based on Stark's design.\nStark refuses to hand over the weapons system to the US Government, claiming that foreign nations and business competitors (including Hammer Industries) are decades away from successfully recreating his achievements, and that the armor is in fact his own property.The palladium core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he has failed to find a substitute. Stark's blood Toxicity is already at 19%. The continuous use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating Stark's condition, and the Arc reactor is depleting Palladium cores at a high rate. There is no known replacement for the Palladium core.\nGrowing increasingly despondent and reckless due to his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) CEO of Stark Industries and replaces Potts with Stark employee Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson).\nHappy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is Tony Stark's bodyguard and chauffeur.Stark travels to Monaco with Pepper and Natalie. He decides to race himself in an F1 car as his blood Toxicity reaches 53% and Stark knows that he does not have much longer to live.\nVanko attacks Stark while racing at the Circuit De Monaco, using an arc reactor of his own powering whip-like energy weapons. Using his weapons, Vanko cuts Tony's F1 car into 2 pieces.\nSeeing the attack, Happy and Pepper drive on to the course with their Rolls Royce to deliver Stark's suit to him.\nStark defeats Vanko with the aid of his portable briefcase armor and learns that Vanko is the son of his father's old partner, Anton Vanko, who had collaborated with Howard on the first arc reactor. Anton had defected to the US in 1963.\nAnton was deported to his native Soviet Union in 1967 following attempts to profit from the technology and died in poverty, explaining Vanko's desire for revenge on the Stark family. Ivan was conviction of trying to sell Soviet era weapons grade Plutonium to Pakistan and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison.\nRival defense contractor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) fakes Vanko's death inside prison, plans his escape and recruits him to perfect a line of armored combat suits to upstage Stark at Stark's expo.At what he believes is his last birthday party, Stark gets drunk while using the Iron Man armor, forcing his friend, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), to intervene. Strak had told Rhodes about the Palladium poisoning. Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II armor and battles Stark. The battle ends when the combatants both fire Repulsor beams at each other, creating a huge explosion. After fighting with Stark, Rhodes delivers the armor to the military. Hammer gets the contract to integrate advanced weapons into the Iron Man suit.Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of S.H.I.E.L.D., approaches Stark, revealing Rushman as undercover agent Natasha Romanoff and that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury gives him some of his father's old material; a hidden message in the diorama of the 1974 Stark Expo proves to be a diagram of the structure of a new element. With the aid of his computer J.A.R.V.I.S. (Paul Bettany), Stark synthesizes it.\nVanko reveals to Stark that he is still alive and seeking revenge so Stark uses the untested element, removing his dependency on the Palladium.Vanko fails to deliver the combat suits to Hammer and instead says that he has worked on armored drones. This angers Hammer, but he has no choice.\nAt the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weapons laden version of the Mark II armor.\nStark arrives in his new armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko seizes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor, and attacks Iron Man. Hammer is arrested while Stark's bodyguard Happy Hogan and Romanoff attempt to capture Vanko. He escapes, but Romanoff hacks Vanko's network and returns control of the Mark II armor to Rhodes.After defeating his drones Stark and Rhodes confront Vanko himself, now in a new, very powerful suit of armor. Neither can match Vanko, but Vanko is ultimately defeated when they fire Repulsor rays at each other, causing a large explosion. With his suit too damaged to continue the fight Vanko activates his suit's self-destruct mechanism, along with that of his drones, apparently killing himself in the process. Stark saves Potts from the exploding drones' remains. Potts quits as CEO, and she and Stark kiss.At a debriefing, while news footage of the Hulk's rampage plays, Fury informs Stark that while Iron Man is a suitable candidate for the \"Avengers Initiative\", he himself is not. Stark agrees to serve as a consultant if Senator Stern acts as presenter at a ceremony planned for awarding Stark and Rhodes with medals for bravery, which Stern reluctantly does.In a post-credits scene, S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) reports the discovery of a large hammer at the bottom of a crater in a New Mexico desert.",
