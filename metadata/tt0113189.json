	"description": "In 1986, MI6 agents James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) and Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean) infiltrate a Soviet chemical weapons facility in Arkhangelsk. While Trevelyan is seemingly caught by Colonel Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov (Gottfried John)(a Hero of the Soviet Union, Commander of Russia's Space Division. He is secretly an agent of Janus who abuses his authority and position to obtain control over the GoldenEye), the facility's commanding officer. Ourumov, then orders Bond to surrender. Bond resets the charge timers from 6 minutes (as discussed with Alec earlier) to 3 and walks out to surrender just as Ourumov executes Alec. As the bombs explode, Bond escapes by dropping off a cliff in a bike & entering a falling rotor plane.Bill Tanner (Michael Kitchen), M's chief of staff. Miss Moneypenny (Samantha Bond), M's secretary. Q (Desmond Llewelyn), the head of Q Branch (research and development division of the British Secret Service). Caroline (Serena Gordon), an MI6 psychological and psychiatric evaluation doctor whom Bond seduces at the beginning of the filmWhile undergoing an assessment nine years later, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Bond's current assignment is to observe Russian involvement in the demonstration of a French hi-tech helicopter Eurocopter Tiger, which is EMP proof. He is ordered to follow Xenia Onatopp, a Russian helicopter pilot. Xenia is the mistress of a Canadian Air Force captain (in charge of piloting the Tiger helicopter at the demo) whom she later murders during sex by crushing his chest between her thighs (his ID is taken by Ourumov). Bond attempts to prevent Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen)(a Georgian fighter pilot and Trevelyan's goon. A sadistic lust murderer), a member of the Janus crime syndicate, from stealing a Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopter (together with Ourumov, who gets on to the demo ship and kill the Tiger pilots and take their places in the helicopter) during a military demonstration in Monte Carlo, but fails (he realizes too late that Onatopp killed the captain and stole his ID).Returning to London, Bond oversees MI6 staff monitoring a distress signal from Severnaya, Siberia, after the stolen helicopter turns up at a Space Weapons Control facility there. An electromagnetic pulse blast suddenly hits the site, destroying it and three Russian fighter jets sent to investigate a distress call while knocking out all satellite systems in orbit above.\nThe newly-appointed female M (Judi Dench's first appearance) assigns Bond to investigate after it is determined the blast came from a Soviet-era satellite armed with a nuclear electromagnetic pulse space-based weapon, code-named \"GoldenEye.\" Although Janus is suspected of initiating the attack, Bond suspects Ourumov, now a general, had involvement due to the weapon system requiring high-level military access.\nOuromov had attacked the facility with Onatopp. He took away the satellite access controls for one weapon and aimed the other weapon at Severnaya itself to erase all evidence of his crime.. He got away in the Tiger, which was unaffected by the EMP blast. Unknown to Ourumov, one analyst survived the attack.Russian Minister of Defence Dimitri Mishkin (Tchéky Karyo) hauls in Ourumov for questioning over the Severnaya incident. Ourumov was unaware that one analyst survived the blast.\nTravelling to Saint Petersburg, Bond is advised by his CIA contact Jack Wade (Joe Don Baker) to meet former KGB agent-turned-gangster Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane) and have him arrange a meeting with Janus. Escorted to the meeting by Onatopp, Bond discovers that Janus is led by Trevelyan (scarred following the attack at Arkhangelsk), having faked his death at Arkhangelsk, and learns he is descended from the Cossacks (who collaborated with the NAzis against communists in WW II. At the end of the war they surrendered to the British with a promise of citizenship) who were repatriated to the Soviet Union and were tortured and killed for their betrayal.\nLearning that Trevelyan seeks revenge against Britain for betraying his parents, who survived the purge but killed themselves out of shame, Bond is sedated before he can kill him, and trapped in the stolen Tiger alongside Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco), a survivor of the Severnaya attack (She was able to contact Boris (the analyst who conspired with Ourumov) from an internet chat cafe. But when she goes to meet him, she is also sedated and put in the tiger by Ourumov, who wants to cover his tracks against Dimitri). Despite escaping before the helicopter's missiles destroy it, the pair are captured by Russian troops and taken before Russian Minister of Defence Dimitri Mishkin for interrogation.The heated argument between the men leads Natalya to prove Ourumov's involvement in the use of GoldenEye, revealing that fellow programmer Boris Grishenko (Alan Cumming) survived along with her, and is now working for Janus in operating a second GoldenEye satellite. Before Mishkin can act on the information, Ourumov arrives and kills him. Bond escapes, pursuing Ourumov in a tank, across St Petersburg, to rescue Natalya. The chase leads to a missile train used by Janus, in which Bond kills Ourumov (he derails the train by putting the tank in its tracks and firing the cannon at it.. Bond tells Ourumov that Alec is a Cossack and turns Ourumov against Alec). Alec traps Bond and Natalya inside the train and gives him 3 mins. Bond escapes from the train with Natalya before Trevelyan destroys it.Bond and Natalya travel to Cuba (using the internet connection on the train, Natalya was able to track Boris to Cuba), after Boris is traced to a location within the island's jungles. While flying over the area, the pair are shot down. Onatopp attacks them after they crash land, but Bond kills her during the fight. The pair soon uncover a hidden base beneath a large lake, concealing a satellite dish, and proceed to infiltrate it. Bond is captured while trying to rig explosives to destroy the base, and learns from Trevelyan that he intends to use GoldenEye to devastate London to conceal the theft of financial records from the Bank of England, meaning that, in Trevelyan's words, \"the United Kingdom will re-enter the Stone Age\" and \"learn the price of betrayal - inflation adjusted for 1945.\" While Natalya is captured as well, she manages to hack into the satellite and reprogram it to initiate atmospheric re-entry and thus destroy itself. When Boris loses his cool trying to undo her programming, Bond uses the moment to trigger a grenade, concealed in a pen, to allow him and Natalya to escape.To prevent Boris from regaining control of the satellite, Bond proceeds to sabotage the dish's antennae by jamming its gears. Trevelyan tries to stop him, and the ensuing fight between the two culminates in him being dangled below the antennae. When asked who his death is for, Bond admits it is for himself, before letting Trevelyan plummet to the ground, mortally wounding him. Natalya soon rescues him in a commandeered helicopter, moments before the antennae malfunctions and explodes, destroying the base and killing its personnel, with Trevelyan killed by falling debris, and Boris killed by being frozen by ruptured liquid nitrogen canisters. After landing somewhere safe, the pair prepare to enjoy some solitude together but are interrupted by the arrival of Wade and a team of U.S. Marines, who escort them to Guantanamo base.",
