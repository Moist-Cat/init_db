	"description": "In a voiceover, mob boss Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) narrates a brief history of the Mafia during 1957: in the wake of Albert Anastasia's death, the dispute over whether Vito Genovese, Carlo Gambino or Joe Bananas will ascend to mob supremacy results in the Apalachin Meeting in upstate New York. The meeting breaks up when it is raided by the FBI, and the Mafia doesn't call a nationwide summit again until the present day.Vitti and his best friend Dominic (Joseph Rigano) are discussing the upcoming meeting at a restaurant. Dominic warns that the mafia is in deep trouble, due to the FBI's unprecedented success in turning \"made\" mobsters into informants and putting bosses in prison, not to mention competition from incoming Chinese and Russian gangsters. As they exit the restaurant, Dominic warns Vitti to look out for Young Turk boss Primo Sindone (Chazz Palminteri). Vitti turns back to get a toothpick, which saves his life when gunmen drive past and gun down Dominic.Psychiatrist Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) is facing his own problems: his son from his first marriage keeps listening to his sessions, his patients are not challenging enough and his wedding, to Laura MacNamara (Lisa Kudrow) in Miami, is coming soon. Sobel accidentally rear-ends a car belonging to Paul Vitti and the trunk pops open, but Jelly (Joe Viterelli), one of Vitti's henchmen, takes the blame because someone is bound and gagged in there (which Sobel and his son do not notice as they are arguing). Sobel gives Jelly his business card in case he changes his mind about compensation.During a meeting with his friends, Vitti suffers a panic attack and privately tells Jelly that he needs to see a psychiatrist for \"a friend\" of his, but it has to be kept a secret. Jelly recommends Sobel.\nVitti visits Sobel claiming his friend needs therapy. Sobel realizes the friend is Vitti himself but impresses Vitti enough to want to see him whenever necessary. Sobel leaves with his son for his wedding in Miami, but Vitti, Jelly and their men follow him. Vitti failed to perform while having sex with his girlfriend and blames Sobel's \"bad service\". Vitti explains he has been having a hard time and Sobel suggests the source of the problem might be stress. Vitti is impressed and makes Sobel his psychiatrist.The next day Vitti has another panic attack and requests to see Sobel. Vitti explains his bleak history with his father to Sobel, who thinks this might have something to do with Vitti's problems. The wedding day arrives, but so does an assassin, sent by Primo to kill Vitti. The assassin kills one of Vitti's friends, but is subdued by Vitti and Jelly, who throw him out of a window to his death just before Sobel can say \"I do\". Sobel confronts Vitti and argues with him until he becomes angry. Sobel suggests he take his anger out on Primo, but in a calm way. Vitti phones Primo and attempts to forgive him but ends up threatening to kill him.Sobel and his family return to New York, where they find a gigantic fountain in their garden (a gift from Vitti) and the FBI in their house. The FBI have monitored Vitti for the past few weeks and noticed Sobel with him. They request Sobel spy on Vitti, but he initially refuses, until changing his mind when the FBI play a recorded tape of Vitti speaking with another mobster, in which Vitti reveals his intention to kill Sobel (the tape was altered by the FBI in an attempt to sway Sobel to their side: Vitti had actually said that he would kill anyone who harmed Sobel).Sobel wears a tape recorder in his next meeting with Vitti but throws it away once he hears from Jimmy that Vitti's father was murdered before his eyes when Vitti was still a child, at the very restaurant where they are having lunch. Sobel believes he might be able to help Vitti after all, but Vitti, informed that Sobel was working with the FBI, takes him to a secluded place to kill him. Sobel and Vitti get into another argument, and Vitti cries upon being reminded of his father's murder, which he blames himself for.Assassins sent by Primo ambush them, and a gunfight ensues. Primo's men are killed by Jelly and Jimmy, and Vitti thanks Sobel for saving his life. The day of the meeting arrives, but Vitti has another crisis, rendering him unable to attend. Jelly interrupts Sobel's wedding, requesting Sobel attend the meeting as Vitti's Consigliere. Sobel is terrified, but his self-confidence builds and he cheeks Primo to the point that Primo pulls a gun on him. Vitti arrives, ordering Primo to stand down and announces he knows a traitor in his own family killed Dominic, but will not seek revenge and instead retire from the mafia. Once outside, another gun battle ensues between Vitti and Primo's men, during which Sobel inadvertently takes a bullet to the shoulder whilst protecting Vitti. The FBI intervenes and the mobsters are arrested while Sobel is taken to hospital.Sobel visits Vitti in Sing Sing prison and Vitti thanks Sobel for all the help he has given him. The film ends with Sobel dancing with his newly wed wife to Tony Bennett songs at their house, which are played live by Bennett as a favor from Vitti.",
