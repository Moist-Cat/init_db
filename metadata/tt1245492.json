	"description": "Jay Baruchel arrives in Los Angeles to visit old friend and fellow Canadian actor Seth Rogen, who invites him to a housewarming party hosted by James Franco. There, Jay is uncomfortable at the crowded party (Rihanna hits Michael Cera for slapping her bum. Mindy wants to have sex with Cera. Emma Stone is a snob), so Seth accompanies him to a convenience store where beams of blue light suddenly come down and suck numerous people into the sky, prompting Seth and Jay to flee back to James' house finding the party unharmed. Jay tries to tell how he saw people got sucked off into the sky, but nobody believes him, including Seth (as Seth was trapped under a steel cart at that time in the store)An earthquake then strikes and the crowd rushes outside, witnessing the Hollywood Hills engulfed in flames. Michael Cera, who is high off cocaine, gets impaled by a street light when a sinkhole opens up swallowing himself, Rihanna, Mindy Kaling, Jason Segel, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Martin Starr. Jonah Hill bumps into Jay dropping him into the hole but is able to hold on to a ledge while Jonah runs back into the house.James' assistant Karen is accidentally crushed by Paul Rudd (who arrived late at the party). Aziz Ansari who was hanging from a ledge grabs Kevin Hart's leg to try and get him to pull him up but Aziz gets his arm cut off and falls into the hole. Kevin also falls into the hole while trying to get Aziz's arm off his leg. Jay attempts pull up David Krumholtz but gets dropped into the hole. Jay survives and makes it back inside the house where Seth, James, Jonah, and Craig Robinson are attempting to process what just happened. Jay tells them that the earthquake has destroyed most of Los Angeles. They then take inventory of their supplies, set up a ration system, board up the house and await help (they believe that in an emergency the actors are rescued first).\nAt night Seth tells Jay that if there was a blue light sucking people into the sky (Jay says its the biblical judgment day), that means that they were not good enough to go to heaven.The next morning, Danny McBride, who crashed the party and fell asleep, wakes up first and wastes most of the group's food and water due to his ignorance of the crisis. He disbelieves what the others tell him of the previous night's events until a man outside is decapitated by an unseen creature. The head falls inside the house, leading to some frantic kicking of the severed head, spewing blood all over the house.\nTensions rise due to various conflicts, including Jay and Seth's growing estrangement and the others' skepticism of Jay's belief that the disaster might be the Apocalypse predicted in the Book of Revelation. Emma Watson makes her way back to James' house (she says she hid in a drainpipe for 2-3 days and she believes that its a zombie invasion as she was hearing growling noises), but due to a misunderstanding (Emma goes to sleep, while Jay talks to the group about making her comfortable in a house with 6 guys by not giving sexual assault vibes. The discussion turns to who has the most sexual assault types vibes, which Emma overhears and thinks the guys are making a plan to sexually assault her), she believes the group is planning to sexually assault her and leaves with the group's remaining water.Craig Robinson goes for water stored in James' cellar, but he encounters an unknown being, causing him to believe Jay's theory. Jay and Seth dig through the floor (since the basement is directly underneath, but not accessible from inside the house) and find water, but Danny wastes most of it out of spite (Danny and James had a falling out when James finds that Danny masturbated on his porno magazine and ruined it. They had a big fight) and the others excommunicate him. Before leaving, Danny (tries to shoot everybody with James's gun, only to find that it was filled with blanks) reveals that Jay was in town two months prior, but stayed at a hotel instead of with Seth because of their strained friendship.\nThat night, Jonah prays for Jay to die and is possessed by a demon. Jay and Craig go to a neighbors house to get some supplies. They find food, and Jay suggests that they do not return. But Jay changes his mind when they are attacked by demons inside the neighbors house.\nSeth and James are attacked by the possessed Jonah, but Jay and Craig subdue Jonah and tie him up. During an exorcism attempt, Jay and Seth fight and knock over a candle, starting a fire that engulfs Jonah and the house and forces the others outside.James suggests driving to his home in Malibu, but finds his car guarded by a demon. Craig volunteers to sacrifice himself and is Raptured into Heaven when the plan succeeds; the others realize they can save themselves by performing a selfless act. On the way to Malibu, the three encounter cannibals led by Danny and his gimp, Channing Tatum. When James volunteers to sacrifice himself, a blue beam begins to pull him to Heaven, but when he taunts and insults Danny, the beam vanishes and Danny and the other cannibals eat James alive while Seth and Jay escape and encounter Satan. Jay apologizes to Seth for his wrongdoings while Satan attempts to eat them. A beam strikes Jay and he begins to ascend while Seth does not. Jay grabs Seth's hand, but his presence prevents them from ascending into Heaven; Seth forces Jay to leave him behind whereupon another beam appears around Seth.The pair arrive in Heaven where they are reunited with Craig, who tells them that any wish comes true. After Jay wishes for the Backstreet Boys, the band performs \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" as everyone in Heaven dances.",
