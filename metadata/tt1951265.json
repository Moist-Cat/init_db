	"description": "After being rescued from the destroyed arena in the 75th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), along with fellow Victors Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) and Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin), is taken to District 13, an independent district isolated from the rest of Panem that has been spearheading the rebellion, where she is reunited with her mother and sister Prim (Willow Shields).While recuperating, she is introduced to President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) by Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the rebel leader, and is told that her actions in the arena sparked riots and strikes against the Capitol.\nColonel Boggs is the head of security for District 13. The capitol had bombed the surface of district 13, but since they had experience of the military, they learned to survive underground.\nCoin asks her if she will become the \"Mockingjay\"-the symbol of the rebellion-as part of their \"hearts and minds\" strategy. Beetee has hacked into the Capitol's communications network and can spread the message. Heavensbee proposes to record a series of Propaganda videos around the Mockingjay themed, asking the Districts to rebel against the Capitol.\nKatniss flatly declines, angrily reminding her that they left Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), her portrayed lover and fellow District 12 tribute, behind in the arena. Heavensbee has no way of confirming if Peeta is alive or not.At the suggestion of Plutarch Heavensbee, the former Gamemaker, she is taken to see the ruins of District 12, which was completely leveled by a Capitol bombing campaign (with the exception of the houses in the Victor's Village). Gale (Liam Hemsworth) accompanies Katniss on this flight to district 12. Katniss finds that the Capitol and President Snow have killed thousands of district 12 citizens as a punishment for Katniss's actions.\nKatniss finds Prim's cat in the Victor's village and brings it back with her. Katniss finds a white rose in her house in the village, which is a warning from Snow, and suddenly Katniss is afraid that she is being watched.Snow address Panem and reminds the districts of the contract between the districts and the Capital since the Dark days. He says that the districts provide labor and materials, while Capitol provides security and the rule of law. He bans all imagery of the Mockingjay and executes anyone who was suspected being a protester before.\nKatniss sees that Peeta is being used by Capitol state television to try and quell the rebellion. Peeta urges everyone that a civil war is not in anyone's interest and that the rebels should lay down their arms immediately. Katniss reluctantly changes her mind and agrees to become Coin's Mockingjay, on the condition that Peeta and the other victors (Johanna and Annie) will be rescued at the earliest opportunity and pardoned, and that her sister, Prim, will be allowed to keep her cat.\nKatniss notes that district 13 has almost no children and learns that most of them were lost in an epidemic a few years ago.After Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) notes that Katniss thrives on spontaneity, she is introduced to her film team (led by Capitol escapee Cressida (Natalie Dormer)), is dressed up in a specially-designed outfit, and given Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) as a stylist (Effie is convinced by Plutarch Heavensbee to join the rebel cause & be Katniss's stylist, as she can't go back to the capitol, after having being rescued from the arena by rebel forces) and close friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) as a bodyguard. Effie informs Katniss that Cinna is dead but uses his work to design the new Mockingjay costumes for Katniss. Castor (Wes Chatham) is the cameraman.\nStill, Katniss's speeches to the camera are flat, lack any sort of rage or emotion. The team is afraid that this is how the revolution will die.They go out to District 8 to visit a hospital, but as the visit concludes, a Capitol bombing squadron arrives and bombs the hospital, killing everyone inside. President Snow had spy cameras everywhere who had recorded Katniss arriving at District 8. Hence Snow ordered the bombing to send a message to the rebels, that there will be a cost to be friends with Katniss. Katniss manages to shoot down both bombers with her arrows, but not before they completed their mission.\nIn her rage, Katniss gives a rousing speech to the camera, which is broadcast when Beetee hijacks the Capitol's news feed. After it is broadcast, strikers in District 7 kill an entire team of Peacekeepers with hidden land mines.After seeing a weakened Peeta on TV, Katniss argues that Peeta does not know what the Capitol did to District 12, which is why he is making statements against the rebels on TV. The team then goes back to District 12, where Gale tells the story of its destruction (only 915 of the 10,000 citizens survived), and Katniss is filmed singing \"The Hanging Tree\". After that is broadcast, a rebel demolition team from District 5 destroys the dam providing the Capitol with electricity, forcing them to use power generators and weakening their ability to broadcast their propaganda.That night, Katniss watches Peeta being interviewed by Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), the Games' former presenter, when, in an apparent defiance of his captors, Peeta suddenly shouts a warning that the Capitol is about to attack District 13.\nCoin orders a mass evacuation into the underground shelters. While Prim is nearly locked out when she goes back to get her cat, everyone manages to get inside safely, and the facility survives the attack unharmed.Upon emerging, Katniss discovers that the area is littered with white roses, realizes that President Snow (Donald Sutherland) has sent them to taunt her, and presumes that he is about to kill Peeta.\nAs Peeta's warning gave the District an additional eight minutes evacuation time, Coin dispatches an elite special forces team, which includes Gale, to rescue him, along with Johanna Mason (Jena Malone), and Annie Cresta (Stef Dawson), the remaining Victors, from their prison in the Capitol's Tribute center. The rescue is successful. However, when Katniss goes to greet Peeta, he unexpectedly attacks and strangles her into unconsciousness, before being knocked unconscious himself by Boggs (Mahershala Ali).Katniss wakes up in the medical facility and is informed that Peeta has been \"hijacked\" - a form of physical/mental torture in which he is brainwashed into wanting to kill Katniss by associating memories of her with the psychological terror created by Tracker Jacker venom - explaining why the Capitol allowed Gale's team to escape.\nA process to undo the effects then begins, with Peeta kept in isolation. Meanwhile, Coin announces the successful rescue of the Victors, and that their next objective is the Capitol's principal military stronghold in the ravines on District 2.",
