	"description": "Kirk Kettner (Jay Baruchel) is a twenty-something TSA agent employed at the Pittsburgh International Airport along with his friends, fellow TSA agent Stainer (T. J. Miller), airline reservations agent Devon (Nate Torrence), and baggage handler Jack (Mike Vogel). Kirk has a poor track record with dating and is hoping to reconcile with his self-centered ex-girlfriend, Marnie (Lindsay Sloane). Kirk is shown to have a low self-esteem and is massively short on confidence. Stainer doesn't like Marnie very much.\nKirk tells his friends that he has been out there, and he doesn't think that it gets any better. Jack says Kirk is a \"Moodle - a Man Poodle\", and girls like to take him out for a walk, feed and cuddle him, but no girl wants to do it with a Moodle.\nMarnie has broken up with him two years earlier and having since found a new boyfriend Ron (Hayes MacArthur), has remained close with Kirk's parents (Debra Jo Rupp and Adam LeFevre) and brother Dylan (Kyle Bornheimer). Marnie is closer to Kirk's parents than he himself is. Marnie is dating Dylan's friend Ron. Debbie (Jessica St. Clair) is Dylan's fiance, who enjoys bullying Kirk.\nMarnie believes that Kirk has no hope of becoming a pilot while he works airport security. Marnie and Ron are invited by the family to their annual vacation to Branson.Fuller (Andy Daly) is Kirk's boss at the TSA. At work one morning, a beautiful woman, Molly McCleish (Alice Eve), arrives at the passenger terminal to board a flight to New York City. While proceeding through the TSA security checkpoint, Molly's striking looks attract unwanted attention from several male TSA agents who want to search her \"properly\" before allowing her to board her flight. Kirk is the only TSA agent to treat Molly courteously.\nMolly accidentally leaves her phone in the airport security area. Calling up her phone, Kirk answers and arranges a time to meet the following evening so that Kirk can return it.When Devon and Kirk arrive at the Andy Warhol Museum, where Molly, a lawyer-turned-event planner, is managing an event. Kirk collides with Molly's sister, Katie (Kim Shaw) (who is working as a waitress at the event and is shown to be very irresponsible) and spills his drink on the museum director.\nKirk takes the blame for the incident to protect Katie, after which a grateful Molly offers Kirk tickets to a Pittsburgh Penguins hockey game at the Mellon Arena. Kirk and Stainer meet Molly and her friend Patty (Krysten Ritter), who develops an immediate mutual loathing with Stainer (he subsequently refers to her as \"The Hamburglar\"). Stainer convinces Kirk that Molly has come to set up Kirk with Patty.\nAt the game, Kirk, still convinced Molly is not interested in him, assumes Molly meant to set him up with Patty. Patty tells Kirk that she is not interested in Stainer, which makes Kirk realize that this is a double date, and that Molly is on a date with Kirk. Patty explicitly tells Kirk of Molly's interest in him.The two begin to date after this, with Kirk confiding in her his dream of becoming a pilot someday, though Stainer predicts their relationship will fail as he deems Molly a \"10\" in a scale of attractiveness, and Kirk only a \"5\", telling him a girl he loved once broke up with him for this very reason. One cannot jump more than 2 points in the dating game.\nPatty, for her part, believes Molly had only chosen Kirk because he was a \"safe\" choice after being hurt by her last boyfriend, Air Force pilot Cam (Geoff Stults). When Cam meets Kirk for the first time (while he was on a dinner date with Molly), he assumes Kirk is a gay friend of Molly's. Molly is now working with Cam to put on an event at the upcoming air show. At the end of the date, Molly can sense that Kirk is preoccupied with Cam, and she kisses Kirk.Molly then invites herself to Kirk's family lunch, where she charms his family and even Ron (Hayes MacArthur), Dylan's best friend. Molly's attentions to Kirk stir jealousy in Marnie, who feels upstaged by Molly's attractiveness, and takes a sudden interest in Kirk again. Dylan wants to hire Molly for his wedding planning, but Molly says that her base fee is $15,000 and the whole event will cost around $50,000. Molly is invited to Branson for the family vacation.\nBeing with Molly improves Kirk's confidence in front of Dylan and Kirk beats Dylan in a game of hockey.After returning to Molly's apartment, Kirk ejaculates prematurely in his pants during sex, just as Molly's parents (played by Alice Eve's real-life parents, Sharon Maughan and Trevor Eve) arrive for a surprise visit. Desperate to conceal the stain on his pants, Kirk seems discourteous by avoiding standing up and shake hands, and quickly leaves Molly's apartment. Molly grows cool to Kirk after this, believing he fled to avoid meeting her parents and while she spent an entire day with his parents and his family.\nKirk calls Molly 17 times, but she refuses to pick up his phone. Stainer says that balance is restored to the Universe with Molly and Kirk breaking up. Devon disagrees and says that when you are with the right girl, the numbers (10 or a 5) don't matter.\nAt Jack's urging, Kirk admits the true reasons for his leaving to Molly, and their relationship resumes.During a date, Kirk suggests to Molly that she throw a birthday party for Katie (with music provided by Stainer's Hall and Oates tribute band, \"Adult Education\"). Kirk is troubled, however, when Molly is intentionally vague about Kirk's line of work to her parents.\nHe's also intrigued when Cam alludes to Molly having some sort of \"defect\". After the party, both go back to Molly's apartment, where Kirk discovers Molly's \"defect\" is slightly webbed toes, which Kirk considers so minor that he decides that she is indeed too perfect for him. Molly is upset that Kirk felt he could only be with her if something was wrong with her.\nAfter telling Kirk that Molly and Cam had broken up because of his own insecurities, with him even cheating on her, she admits she had indeed asked him out because she considered him safe.Kirk leaves and later resumes his relationship with Marnie, planning on a family trip to Branson.\nStainer and Patty realize their mistake in telling Kirk and Molly it wouldn't work out; Stainer tells Kirk that he is a \"10\" too. They pull Kirk off his plane as the aircraft prepares to depart to Branson as he tries to leave with his family and Marnie, while Patty brings Molly to the airport. Kirk rejects Marnie during an unorthodox airport pursuit and reunites with Molly.\nLater, as a surprise, Kirk takes Molly on a trip in a small plane, with him as pilot; he has taken flying lessons and achieved his goal."
