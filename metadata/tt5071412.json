	"description": "The Byrdes and their teenage kids Charlotte and Jonah look like, and mostly are, an ordinary family with ordinary lives. Except that husband/father Marty, a Chicago financial advisor, also serves as the top money-launderer for Mexico's second-largest drug cartel. When things go awry, he must uproot his family from the skyscrapers of Chicago and relocate to the lazy lake region of the Missouri Ozarks.",
