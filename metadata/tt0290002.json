	"description": "In this sequel to 'Meet the Parents,' Gaylord Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) has finally invited his fianc√©e's parents, ex-CIA agent Jack Byrnes and his wife Dina (Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner) to meet his parents. Jack wants to know if Greg came from a good gene pool. Jack discovers that the Fockers are very strange. The Dad, Bernard (Dustin Hoffman) is a hippie and retired lawyer, and the Mom, Roz (Barbara Streisand) is an open sex therapist. Jack begins to thinks this is not a good family for his daughter to marry into. Greg's parents are so proud of Greg that they have a wall of honor with Greg's ninth and tenth place sports awards. The two families try to become one family.",
